    Arrays 
    
   1.Definition

   An array is the simplest data structure consists of a collection of elements each identified by an   
   index. TheyAre used to store data of the same type in adjacent blocks. Many data structures like    
   stack and queue are derived from array.

   2.Function
    Saving data types in sequence in a simple way.
    Effective acces to elements using indexing.
   

   3.charactrestics
    *Elements must be of the same data type.	
    *The index start with zero or one depending on the language.
    *Size is defined during the time of creation which could be a con as prevents further updates.
    
   4.Operations on array

   Accesing an element in the array (Arrayname[I]) where I is the index of the array.
   
  7.Application
   
  *Implementing data structures like stacks and queues.
  *Representing matrices in numerical computations.
  *Storing pixels in image processing.
   
  8.Conclusion

  Array is the simplest and fastest data structure to use to save related values of the same data   
  type in sequence.
